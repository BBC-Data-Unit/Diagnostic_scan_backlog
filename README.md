Millions of potentially life-saving scans were missed during the first six months of the pandemic.

In December, 2020, the shared data unit found millions of people missed out on potentially life-saving scans when non-Covid NHS services ground to a halt during the pandemic.


Analysis of official figures found at least 4.4m less diagnostic imaging scans were carried out in England in the six months between April and September 2020, compared to the same period in 2019.

Analysis also revealed a wide variation in how hospitals were rebuilding capacity.

In one hospital, almost 80% of patients were waiting more than six weeks for a scan compared to zero in 2020.

In the North West, one in three patients were waiting more than six weeks for a scan, compared to one in five in the South East.

In Scotland, almost half (47%) of those in need of key diagnostic tests in Scotland were waiting more than the six-week recommended limit.

While the NHS and professional bodies said hospitals were forced to cancel elective appointments to limit patients in wards, the pandemic exposed flaws in the health service’s ability to diagnose serious conditions early, experts said.

Two top radiologists said an historical lack of staff, as well as a shortage in CT and MRI scanners, had been “exacerbated” by Covid-19.
